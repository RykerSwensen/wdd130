      <h3>[Random Geek Things]</h3>
      <p>
        [Random-Geek-Things is a page I want to dedicate to interesting gaming
        hardware throughout history. Things that I may have owned in the past,
        or things that I have wanted to own. From gaming mice, keyboards,
        monitors, graphics cards, cpu’s ram, consoles, to guidebooks,
        merchandise, and history. This page is like a junk drawer of things I am
        nostalgic for. Things that may bring back memories for you too. I live
        in a tiny house, so collecting computer hardware is not really fit into
        my lifestyle, however, documenting things like this is another fun way
        of recalling fun or not-so-fun memories we have had with gaming. This
        page is almost anything goes, however I will structure it in a way to be
        easy to read about the things you may be nostalgic for. ]
