        <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 Review</h1>
        <h2>Red Dead Redemption 2: One of the greatest flawed games I have ever played.</h2>
        <h4>Upon starting Red Dead Redemption 2, you learn that you are a bad person in a gang of bad people running from another gang of bad people. It is a slow beginning. A long horse ride of listening to dialog. While this game does have epic western action moments, it is the long slow dialog moments that make this game. If you are not a fan of slower story based games, this 70 hour game is not for you.</h4>
