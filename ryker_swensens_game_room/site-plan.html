      <p>
        [Do you feel like you never have enough time? School, work, assignments,
        and projects seem to keep us more than busy. Have you ever tried to play
        a video game after a long day that just wasted your time? Wasting your
        precious and rare free time? My goal is to help stop that. To help
        provide you with information on the quality and optimization of a game.
        Using the Epic-Games Store, I will provide information on the free game,
        and whether or not it is worth your time downloading and playing. ]

        [Hello, and welcome to Rykers Game Room. Here at Rykers Game Room, I am
        here to give you my personal opinions on games I have played as a
        student who also works full time. Our time is so valuable, and there is
        a lot of games, especially modern games, that do not respect your time.
        So many pointless grindy quests that take hours to progress, and
        honestly arent that fun. I would like to share some great games, who I
        think they are for, and a good price to pay for each game! I will also
        share some other nerdy video game-related things that interest me and
        may interest you. Some games I will be discussing will be; Red Dead
        Redemption 2, Breath of the Wild, Elden ring, and more! As for other
        things I will discuss, I will discuss system requirements at what I
        consider the bare modern minimum 1080p 60fps. Is the game well
        optimized? Story quality? Game design? Uniqueness? I would also like to
        talk about some system hardware. Video game consoles, GPUs, CPUs,
        Monitors, etc. Students are on strict budgets, and we cant afford
        high-end systems. Budget gaming is a great way to get started on the
        game. However, many “budget” options are awful and just not worth the
        low price. While we dont expect much from more affordable options, it
        isnt fair to spend money on something that is not passable. From
        monitors with bad response time and inferior colors to membrane
        keyboards and mice that stutter. We deserve to have a reasonable
        experience. Some products in the budget category are amazing, while some
        are awful. I personally use a budget Lenovo Legion 5. It is a few years
        old, and I picked it up for $500. Its Specs are I7-10750H, 1660ti, 8gb
        of ram, and a 256gb gen 3 ssd. I later upgraded to 16gb of ram, and a
        gen 4 ssd. I am right in the middle of mid-range systems. My system is
        great I wont lie, but I will try to consider the average gaming laptops
        with a 1050 or 1050ti. As well as systems with Ryzen Vega graphics. ]

      <h3>[Reviews]</h3>
      <p>
        [Red Dead Redemption 2 Review Red Dead Redemption 2: One of the greatest
        flawed games I have ever played. Upon starting Red Dead Redemption 2,
        you learn that you are a bad person in a gang of bad people running from
        another gang of bad people. It is a slow beginning. A long horse ride of
        listening to dialog. While this game does have epic western action
        moments, it is the long slow dialog moments that make this game. If you
        are not a fan of slower story based games, this 70 hour game is not for
        you. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a story of a man who was raised by a gang
        of outlaws. Arthur Morgan. Arthur is not the most interesting character.
        Arthur is slow, funny, and not too bright. However, it is the lessons
        you learn as the story progresses with Arthur. WARNING BIG SPOILER ALERT
        What made Red Dead Redemption 2 such an important game to me, was all
        the emotions it made me feel throughout the game. You start off thinking
        you are an outlaw. I played recklessly and without care. I didn't care
        who or whom I would hurt along the way. However, I learned to love some
        of the characters I interacted with throughout my 90-hour playthrough. I
        also learned to hate some characters along the way too. I watched people
        I spent tens of hours with turn on me, succumb to greed and power. I
        watched Arthur fall sick and learn he did not have much time left. As
        soon as Arthur learned of his sickness, the game changed completely for
        me. I watched the choices I made affect people in negative ways. Widowed
        wives, people struggling with money, and people who were wronged. I
        watched Arthur pay the price and consequence of making bad decisions. It
        was so powerful and so beautiful, It is the single greatest story I have
        ever been told. ]

      <h3>[Random Geek Things]</h3>
      <p>
        [Random-Geek-Things is a page I want to dedicate to interesting gaming
        hardware throughout history. Things that I may have owned in the past,
        or things that I have wanted to own. From gaming mice, keyboards,
        monitors, graphics cards, cpu’s ram, consoles, to guidebooks,
        merchandise, and history. This page is like a junk drawer of things I am
        nostalgic for. Things that may bring back memories for you too. I live
        in a tiny house, so collecting computer hardware is not really fit into
        my lifestyle, however, documenting things like this is another fun way
        of recalling fun or not-so-fun memories we have had with gaming. This
        page is almost anything goes, however I will structure it in a way to be
        easy to read about the things you may be nostalgic for. ]
