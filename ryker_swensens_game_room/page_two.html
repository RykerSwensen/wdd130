        [Hello, and welcome to Rykers Game Room. Here at Rykers Game Room, I am
        here to give you my personal opinions on games I have played as a
        student who also works full time. Our time is so valuable, and there is
        a lot of games, especially modern games, that do not respect your time.
        So many pointless grindy quests that take hours to progress, and
        honestly arent that fun. I would like to share some great games, who I
        think they are for, and a good price to pay for each game! I will also
        share some other nerdy video game-related things that interest me and
        may interest you. Some games I will be discussing will be; Red Dead
        Redemption 2, Breath of the Wild, Elden ring, and more! As for other
        things I will discuss, I will discuss system requirements at what I
        consider the bare modern minimum 1080p 60fps. Is the game well
        optimized? Story quality? Game design? Uniqueness? I would also like to
        talk about some system hardware. Video game consoles, GPUs, CPUs,
        Monitors, etc. Students are on strict budgets, and we cant afford
        high-end systems. Budget gaming is a great way to get started on the
        game. However, many “budget” options are awful and just not worth the
        low price. While we dont expect much from more affordable options, it
        isnt fair to spend money on something that is not passable. From
        monitors with bad response time and inferior colors to membrane
        keyboards and mice that stutter. We deserve to have a reasonable
        experience. Some products in the budget category are amazing, while some
        are awful. I personally use a budget Lenovo Legion 5. It is a few years
        old, and I picked it up for $500. Its Specs are I7-10750H, 1660ti, 8gb
        of ram, and a 256gb gen 3 ssd. I later upgraded to 16gb of ram, and a
        gen 4 ssd. I am right in the middle of mid-range systems. My system is
        great I wont lie, but I will try to consider the average gaming laptops
        with a 1050 or 1050ti. As well as systems with Ryzen Vega graphics. ]
